# Social-Media-APi

This project demonstrates a Social Network API, designed to manage and interact with a social network's user data and activity. Leveraging Express.js for routing, MongoDB for data storage, and Mongoose ODM for data modeling, this API enables users to share thoughts, react to friends' posts, and manage their friend lists. This robust back-end solution is ideal for handling large amounts of unstructured data, typical of social networking platforms.
